## Data Processing

We adopt two real-world bioinformatics datasets: nRC and Rfam, reported in [ncrna-deep](https://github.com/bioinformatics-sannio/ncrna-deep.git). For data preprocessing, you can refer to the [Datasets](https://github.com/bioinformatics-sannio/ncrna-deep/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#datasets) section.
