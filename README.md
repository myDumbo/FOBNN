# FOBNN

## Data Processing

We adopt two real-world bioinformatics datasets: nRC and Rfam, reported in [ncrna-deep](https://github.com/bioinformatics-sannio/ncrna-deep.git). For data preprocessing, you can refer to the [Datasets](https://github.com/bioinformatics-sannio/ncrna-deep/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#datasets) section.



## Environment

To train CNN/BNN models and perform oblivious inference, a working environment with the following libraries is necessary:

- python (3.8.16)
- tensorflow (2.10.0)
- numpy (1.24.3)
- sklearn (1.2.2)
- pandas (1.5.3)

- Ubuntu 18.04
- [emp-toolkit](https://github.com/emp-toolkit) library
